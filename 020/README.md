Dear Hack Club friends,

Every summer Hack Clubbers do something special. This Thursday, weâ€™re embarking on our greatest investment in leaders yet: [The Hacker Zephyr](https://zephyr.hackclub.com/), a cross-country hackathon on a train for 42 Hack Club leaders.

*Hereâ€™s your 2-minute read on how weâ€™re building [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)â€”sent to 92 recipients. Thanks for this time together.*

The Hacker Zephyr will be highly technical: There's no internet on the train, so weâ€™ve purchased a refurbished server with 2 CPUs, 192 GB of RAM, and 16 TB of storage. It's hosting an intranet over WiFi, and we've configured a custom DNS server and a deploy flow for both static and dynamic sites. A handful of Hack Clubbers have already mirrored crates.io, npm, and the Ubuntu Package Archive, along with adding offline copies of Stack Overflow and Wikipedia to it. Weâ€™re calling our server and intranet the ZephyrNET.

As the train clacks from Burlington, Vermont to Los Angeles, weâ€™re challenging the 42 Hack Clubbers on board to make 500 contributions to the ZephyrNET.

Hack Club is all about building real projects in the real world. Since this past June, 73 projects were shipped and shared by Hack Clubbers in our online community. Stay tuned for more examples of what Hack Clubbers are building below!

**This month, we thank:**

**SpaceXâ€™s Jamin Gallman, Amy Fels, and Emily Shanklin** for offering to host Hack Club's closing ceremonies at SpaceX's Hawthorne facilities.

**John Abele, founder of Boston Scientific,** for lunch with Zach and connecting Hack Club to some amazing builders, thinkers, and collaborators.

**Ben & Jerryâ€™s Ice Cream co-founder Jerry Greenfield** and **NASA flight director Zeb Scoville** for joining Hack Clubbers' BBQ this Friday on our first night of the cross-country train trip.

**Hack Clubâ€™s snapshot of June activity:**

Hack Clubs are student-led, after-school computer science clubs, and teenagers run hundreds of their own clubs in 22 countries worldwide. In our wholesome online community, in the last 30 days, 250,000 messages were sent between students. Additionally, 252 new students joined the Hack Club Slack since June 1, 2021.

This summer, we hired a Head of Clubs, a VP of Philanthropy, and also an Operations Associate for Hack Club Bank -- all newly created positions. Three new, paid full-time high school interns work around the clock. This week, we signed a lease for office space next door to HQ to handle this growth. Thanks to you, Hack Club is growing and staying free and accessible to all teenagers.
