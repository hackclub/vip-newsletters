*Meet a Hack Clubber!*

*Aileen, 14, of Texas* attended her first ever hackathon with Hack Club this summer. Now, she is learning new coding languages, and collaborating on [Sinerider](https://sinerider.com/), a graphing game alongside other Hack Clubbers. ‚ÄúThese are one of the most memorable moments of my life‚Ä¶ ever,‚Äù Aileen said this summer. See her at min 5:45 in the [video of our hackathon](https://youtu.be/PnK4gzO6S3Q?t=345).

*Big Picture in 2022:*

300 new teen-led coding clubs have started, serving thousands of teenagers in the US, Brazil, India, Portugal, Sweden, and Ghana and 23 other countries. 

You‚Äôve helped us scale Hack Club Bank, which unlocks the financial system for teenagers. $2.8 million has been transacted in 2022! 

More than a dozen in-person, teen-led hackathons have run, with +1k teenagers in attendance‚Äî this is amazing! 

That‚Äôs just a snapshot of your impact. See our [full annual report](http://hack.af/2022) for more.

*Looking ahead*, we‚Äôre dedicating 2023 to making sure more teenagers know about Hack Club, leveraging our incredible new collaboration with FIRST Robotics. We want to help beginners grow as coders. And we will increase our dedicated outreach to girls and low-income teenagers, building on partnerships with Girl Scouts and Girls Who Code.

Your support will bring Hack Club‚Äôs life-changing programs to 10,000 more teenagers in 2023. Please donate today!
