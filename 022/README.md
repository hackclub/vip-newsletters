Dear Hack Club friends,

Happy New Year! Omicron is closing schools nationwide, but every day teenage hackers across the country are building online at Hack Club, like Caleb, 17 of NH, who just built a super [reminder app](https://useresolute.com/) integrated into tools you're probably already using; and Piero, a high school senior from Chicago, who loves trains so much he built [an app](https://amtrak.cc/) to track Amtrak's major routes.

Scroll down to see just a few Hack Clubber projects that will make you feel optimistic for 2022. And look out-- Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder, has just agreed to be Hack Club's next guest speaker.

All of this is thanks to those of you who donate to make Hack Club possible. Here's your 2-minute read on how you're building a better future for young people.

Half the team actively building Hack Club is teenagers, including those writing and designing this newsletter. Plus, 100s of Hack Clubbers volunteer daily in peer-to-peer learning that creates independence and confidence. Cedric, 19, of the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia, a former Hack Club leader, just joined HQ to encourage more teen club leaders like him to ship their code for everyone in our online community.

Welcome Cedric!

**What's new at Hack Club this month:**

- Nearly 200 new Hack Clubs started in the US and around the world including Portugal, Zambia, and Ghana.

- 4 new hires, including engineers to run our Clubs program and our online community, and an operations person to lead Bank.

- 400 organizations now run on Hack Club Bank, our fiscal sponsorship platform, and we're kicking off a partnership with** [Givebutter](https://givebutter.com/fiscal-sponsorship), a fundraising platform.

**In case you missed it, 2021's highlights:**

Elon Musk donated $1 million to Hack Club, along with generous donations from Tom and Theresa-Preston Werner, Joe Liemandt, Vitalik Buterin, Craig Newmark, Adam Ross, Ron Conway, and the Danhakl Family Foundation. Giving to Hack Club doubled in 2022.
