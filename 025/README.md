Hi Hack Club friends,

4 days ago, Hack Clubbers topped Hacker News with SineRider, a new game about love, math, and graphing built by teenagers. It went viral, with 400K+ impressions over the weekend.

As summer wraps, a few more highlights from Hack Clubbers, thanks to you: 
Teenagers returned for the first and largest high school hackathon since the pandemic. Earlier this month, Hack Club's [Assemble](https://github.com/hackclub/assemble) in San Francisco had 600 registrants for 42 hours of nonstop building. 40% were girls and nonbinary.

Hack Club is now collaborating with FIRST¬Æ Robotics to bring software engineering to tens of thousands of technical high school students in 100 different countries enrolled in their robotics competitions. Together, we‚Äôre encouraging teenagers to start hackathons in their community by offering [$500 grants and free services](https://hackclub.com/hackathons/) on Hack Club Bank this fall.

With all the new attention generating interest in clubs, we just launched a new 2-minute clubs [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sxRdKtKNa0) with Hack Clubbers sharing the magic.

...and now we‚Äôre going to turn the newsletter over to Ishan Goel, a 17-year-old Hack Clubber who recently completed an internship here at HQ. He‚Äôs sharing the community newsletter that‚Äôs going out to Hack Clubbers around the world this month.

Check out Maggie's [own bio page here](https://replbio.maggieliu1.repl.co). I asked her how she got the idea for Replbio: _"Glitch has a cool glitch-in-bio project, so i thought it would be fun to make one that worked on Replit and add more features!"_

It lets you view multiple dinos at once instead of scrolling through the [hackclub/dinosaurs](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs) repo. Here's Jaden's motivation behind the [JavaScript project](https://github.com/InternetRamen/dino-explorer) was: _"I made dino explorer to see all the amaazing dinos at once :0"_

### Milkshakes, Stupid Sh*t Nobody Needs & A Rogue Dinosaur.

Yes, I'm talking about Assemble. Or rather, <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39828164?v=4" width="16"> [Sam](https://sampoder.com) is:

How does one put fourty-two hours of chaos into a couple of sentences? I'm not sure, but I'm going to give it a shot. On August 5th, 175 Hack Clubbers descended on Market Street in San Francisco for the first high school hackathon in üåÅ San Francisco since the pandemic! Together, we built projects based on the prompt "Stupid Shit Nobody Needs", fought <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38882631/185447991-cf6a6e84-585e-4f71-9546-fdf315e816ce.png" width="16"> The Organization, chugged down (potentially) dangerous amounts of caffeine, had a late-night disco and much more.

The highlight for me, however, was getting the chance to meet so many Hack Clubbers! We had folks from 12 different countries and 20+ US states, each of them incredibly special individuals who I wish I could have spent hours more talking to. Words really can't describe the ‚ú® magical ‚ú® atmosphere that took over Figma's office that weekend.
