Hi everyone, I hope you're having a great start to the spring.
 
For a teenager, $7/month to host an app is pricey. So, this month a group of 12 Hack Clubbers teamed up to build [Hack as a Service](https://cloud-6v739uwqe-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screen_shot_2021-05-04_at_10.53.01_am.png), a free Heroku alternative for Hack Clubbers. It's written in Go and Next.js by Hack Clubbers from New Hampshire, Greece, California, Texas, Malaysia and Rwanda, collaborating on GitHub. Check out their [internal progress updates and README](https://gist.github.com/zachlatta/a21f0272a85daa91f63590cd813d0b88).
 
***Here’s a 2-minute read on how we’re building [Hack Club](hackclub.com)—sent to 87 recipients, including our major donors & friends. Thanks for this time together.***

**Special thanks from Hack Club to:**
- Adam Ross of Goldcrest Capital for his incredibly generous gift of $100,000 to Hack Club
- Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, for a conversation with Zach Latta about the future
- SpaceX's Gwynne Shotwell for privately mentoring 5 Hack Club students in April

Nearly half of US high schools still don’t offer any quality computer science education. Hack Club is a special place for teenagers curious about computers and coding. When successful, we'll create a new generation of leaders with hard technical skills, an optimistic engineer's mindset, and a powerful network of creative, technical friends.
 
**News:**
 
Three of the five projects selected for [Replit Ventures](https://blog.replit.com/ventures) are led by Hack Clubbers, who will each receive $2,000 and additional support. Thanks to Amjad Masad, Replit founder, Hack Club donor, and friend. (Zach and Amjad will be on Clubhouse this Thursday night talking about coding education.)

Remember [@cow](https://cloud-bpoi9i4vy-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screen_shot_2021-05-04_at_11.22.03_am.png), the AI bot built by [Benjamin Ashbaugh](https://benjaminashbaugh.me/), 15, from Colorado using GPT-3? Last Friday, his Hack Club friend, Jason Antwi-Appiah, also 15, of Texas created another bot named @goat that uses a more powerful GPT-3 model called davinci:

**Summer at Hack Club:**
 
Zach and Hack Club's 3-person engineering team are making big summer plans for live events, internships and supporting Hack Clubbers to make major ships. [Last summer](https://summer.hackclub.com/), we distributed $50,000 in hardware and supported 5,628 projects by teenagers in 28 countries. Stay tuned for our upcoming announcement! 
 
**Hack Clubbers build and ship projects for their friends in our online community:**
- Ishan, 15, of Dubai, used Go to build [Devzat](https://github.com/quackduck/devzat), a new way to chat through SSH. The server has Markdown support (including syntax highlighting), emojis and many different commands. Anyone is able to join by running $ ssh devzat.hackclub.com in their terminal.
 
- Sam, 15, of Singapore, used Next.js to build a [custom waiting room](https://zoom.sampoder.com/) for Zoom so that gives other participants fun facts to cheer them up while they wait for him. He built an API to control the site, and he uses a Raycast Bash script to control it.
 
- Abby, 14, of California, used Xcode and Swift to build her first ever app, [VacLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pcx7WAxlmU), which matches LA’s age qualified residents to a vaccination center near them, for the Technovation Girls competition.
 
- Faisal, 15, of India, created a Slack bot, [@carbon-slack](https://github.com/faisalsayed10/carbon-slack/), that allows users to create beautiful images of code with Carbon directly in Slack and without needing to go to Carbon’s website.
 
- Matthew, 17, of California, has been posting to [Hack Club's Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/) every day for the last 300 days, and just used JavaScript to build a [website](https://scrapbook-countdown.vercel.app/) that counts down the days until he's posted to Scrapbook for a full year. 
 
- Lux, 17, of California, recorded her [first song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3tzNWRwFw0) on the analog modular synthesizer that she built from scratch.
I appreciate your time in reading this, and all the support you give Hack Club. As always, I welcome your responses, questions, and suggestions.

Happy spring! best, Christina
